As per the Gang of Four definitions, the Bridge Pattern 
“Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently“.

In the bridge design pattern, there are 2 parts: the abstraction and the implementation.

The bridge design pattern allows the abstraction and implementation to be developed independently.
The client code can access only the abstraction part without being concerned about the implementation part.

The Bridge Design Pattern separates the abstraction hierarchy and the implementation hierarchy in two different layers,
so that change in one hierarchy will not affect the development or functionality of other hierarchy.
