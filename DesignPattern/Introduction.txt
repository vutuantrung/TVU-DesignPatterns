Structural Design Patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize the relationship among entities.

This design pattern is all about class and object composition.
Structural class creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces.
The structural object patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

The structural patterns describe how objects and classes can be combined to form larger structures.
