What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern ?

According to Gang of Four Definition: 
“The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes“.

In simple words we can say, the Abstract Factory is a super factory that creates other factories.
This Factory is also called Factory of Factories.
